Installable Android Bluetooth Low Energy API
=============================================

Concept
========

So it's been a while since Bluetooth 4.0 was announced, and many cellphones 
that are on the market have support for it. Some OEMs are even starting to
manufacture they're own devices that are compatible with it, but there's 
still no official API on Android to talk to them. This project intends to
fill this gap by providing a vendor extension that can be installed on top
of a rooted device without having to recompile a custom Android like 
Cyagogen Mod.


Building Blocks
================

BlueZ since before 4.93 (BlueZ for ICS) provides with API that allows to
discover BTLE devices over DBus and read and write Characteristics to it to.

The project uses this API as a base so no changes to BlueZ has to be done.
We talk to this API by using dbus-java, this service will register it self
with SystemServer so that it can be exposed to user space API using Binder

DBus API in use
----------------

DBus API that I'm going to use are the ones from:
     * docs/adapter-api.txt [2]
     * docs/attribute-api.txt [1]
     * docs/manager-api.txt [3]     
[1] http://goo.gl/ZYUPj
[2] http://goo.gl/1wR5O
[3] http://goo.gl/VjTcR

Status
=======

* DBus gets connected
* Writting interfaces for BlueZ.
